 !!! Residue MET    4 A has  1 instead of expected   4 sidechain atoms.
     Calculated solvent accessibility refers to incomplete sidechain !!!

 !!! In residue C Y S   249 A alternate location indicator is B and
     not blank,A or 1. Atom named  CA  will be ignored !!!

 !!! In residue C Y S   249 A alternate location indicator is B and
     not blank,A or 1. Atom named  CB  will be ignored !!!

 !!! In residue C Y S   249 A alternate location indicator is B and
     not blank,A or 1. Atom named  SG  will be ignored !!!

 !!! Residue ARG  523 B has  8 instead of expected   7 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!
