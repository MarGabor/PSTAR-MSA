 !!! Residue GLN  152 B has  7 instead of expected   5 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is HE22
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!! Residue GLY  153 B has  1 instead of expected   0 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!
