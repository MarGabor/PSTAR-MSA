 !!! Residue ARG   35 A has 11 instead of expected   7 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is HH22
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!! Residue THR   53 A has  6 instead of expected   3 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is HG23
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!! Residue LEU   57 A has 10 instead of expected   4 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is HD23
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!!          205 hydrogen or deuterium atoms were ignored
     in the calculation of side chain solvent 
     accessibility !!!
