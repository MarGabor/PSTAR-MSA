 !!! Backbone incomplete for residue ARG   13 A
     residue will be ignored !!!

 !!! Residue ARG  177 A has  1 instead of expected   7 sidechain atoms.
     Calculated solvent accessibility refers to incomplete sidechain !!!

 !!! Residue GLN  238 C has  6 instead of expected   5 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!! Excessive C to N distance  1.22149E+01> 2.50000E+00
     before residue ILE   25 D. chain break residue inserted !!!

 !!! Residue ASN   69 D has  5 instead of expected   4 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!!           47 hydrogen or deuterium atoms were ignored
     in the calculation of side chain solvent 
     accessibility !!!
 !!! Strand label restart at A !!!
