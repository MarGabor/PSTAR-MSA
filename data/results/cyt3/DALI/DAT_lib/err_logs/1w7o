 !!! Residue ASN  118 A has  5 instead of expected   4 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!!            1 hydrogen or deuterium atoms were ignored
     in the calculation of side chain solvent 
     accessibility !!!
