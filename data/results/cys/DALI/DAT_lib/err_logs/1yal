 !!! Residue ALA  218 A has  2 instead of expected   1 sidechain atoms.
     last sidechain atom name is  OXT
     calculated solvent accessibility includes extra atoms !!!

 !!!            1 hydrogen or deuterium atoms were ignored
     in the calculation of side chain solvent 
     accessibility !!!
